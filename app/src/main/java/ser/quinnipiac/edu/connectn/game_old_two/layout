so the layout that we need to make:

Game Factory
 -> Handles creating the values of the game
 -> handles rows, columns, connect size
 -> Also handles difficulty Option
Difficulty
 -> Handles the computer variables
 -> Built into the actual game once it's created from Game Factory
 -> 3 hard-coded difficulties: easy, normal, hard
