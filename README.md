A Four-in-a-row Game created as an assignment for `SER-210: Software Engineering Design and Development` (Android Development)

This project was created using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). An initial source code was provided to create an initial structure for the project.

The first part of this project was created using a console-interfaced java project to create the underlying logic and AI. The console version can be found on the [Console Branch](https://github.com/LittleTealeaf/SER-210-Assignment-01/tree/Console)

## Game Rules:

The game takes place on a 6x6 grid. Each player takes turns placing their token piece on an empty spot on the board. The first person to get 4 of their tokens in one line wins. The line can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
